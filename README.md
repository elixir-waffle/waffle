Waffle is a flexible file upload library for Elixir with straightforward integrations for Amazon S3 and ImageMagick.

[Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/waffle)

## Installation

Add the latest stable release to your `mix.exs` file, along with the
required dependencies for `ExAws` if appropriate:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:waffle, "~> 1.1"},

    # If using S3:
    {:ex_aws, "~> 2.1.2"},
    {:ex_aws_s3, "~> 2.0"},
    {:hackney, "~> 1.9"},
    {:sweet_xml, "~> 0.6"}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch the dependencies.

## Usage

After installing Waffle, another two things should be done:

1. setup a storage provider
2. define a definition module

### Setup a storage provider

Waffle has two built-in storage providers:

* `Waffle.Storage.Local`
* `Waffle.Storage.S3`

[Other available storage providers](#other-storage-providers)
are supported by the community.

An example for setting up `Waffle.Storage.Local`:

```elixir
config :waffle,
  storage: Waffle.Storage.Local,
  asset_host: "http://static.example.com" # or {:system, "ASSET_HOST"}
```

An example for setting up `Waffle.Storage.S3`:

```elixir
config :waffle,
  storage: Waffle.Storage.S3,
  bucket: "custom_bucket",                # or {:system, "AWS_S3_BUCKET"}
  asset_host: "http://static.example.com" # or {:system, "ASSET_HOST"}

config :ex_aws,
  json_codec: Jason
  # any configurations provided by https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws
```

### Define a definition module

Waffle requires a **definition module** which contains the relevant
functions to store and retrieve files:

* Optional transformations of the uploaded file
* Where to put your files (the storage directory)
* How to name your files
* How to secure your files (private? Or publicly accessible?)
* Default placeholders

This module can be created manually or generated by `mix waffle.g`
automatically.

As an example, we will generate a definition module for handling
avatars:

    mix waffle.g avatar

This should generate a file at `lib/[APP_NAME]_web/uploaders/avatar.ex`.
Check this file for descriptions of configurable options.

## Examples

* [An example for Local storage driver](documentation/examples/local.md)
* [An example for S3 storage driver](documentation/examples/s3.md)

## Usage with Ecto

Waffle comes with a companion package for use with Ecto. If you
intend to use Waffle with Ecto, it is highly recommended you also
add the
[`waffle_ecto`](https://github.com/elixir-waffle/waffle_ecto)
dependency.  Benefits include:

  * Changeset integration
  * Versioned urls for cache busting (`.../thumb.png?v=63601457477`)

## Other Storage Providers

  * **Rackspace** - [arc_rackspace](https://github.com/lokalebasen/arc_rackspace)

  * **Manta** - [arc_manta](https://github.com/onyxrev/arc_manta)

  * **OVH** - [arc_ovh](https://github.com/stephenmoloney/arc_ovh)

  * **Google Cloud Storage** - [waffle_gcs](https://github.com/elixir-waffle/waffle_gcs)

  * **Microsoft Azure Storage** - [arc_azure](https://github.com/phil-a/arc_azure)

  * **Aliyun OSS Storage** - [waffle_aliyun_oss](https://github.com/ug0/waffle_aliyun_oss)
  
## Testing

The basic test suite can be run with without supplying any S3 information:

```
mix test
```

In order to test S3 capability, you must have access to an S3/equivalent bucket. For
S3 buckets, the bucket must be configured to allow ACLs and it must allow public
access.

The following environment variables will be used by the test suite:

* WAFFLE_TEST_BUCKET
* WAFFLE_TEST_BUCKET2
* WAFFLE_TEST_S3_KEY
* WAFFLE_TEST_S3_SECRET
* WAFFLE_TEST_REGION

After setting these variables, you can run the full test suite with `mix test --include s3:true`.
