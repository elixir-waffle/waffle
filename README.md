![Waffle is a flexible file upload library for Elixir](https://elixir-waffle.github.io/waffle/assets/logo.svg)

Waffle is a flexible file upload library for Elixir with straightforward integrations for Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and ImageMagick.

[Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/waffle)

## Installation

Add the latest stable release to your `mix.exs` file, along with the
required dependencies for your chosen storage provider:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:waffle, "~> 1.1"},

    # If using S3:
    {:ex_aws, "~> 2.1.2"},
    {:ex_aws_s3, "~> 2.0"},
    {:hackney, "~> 1.9"},
    {:sweet_xml, "~> 0.6"},

    # If using Azure Blob Storage:
    {:req, "~> 0.4"},
    {:timex, "~> 3.7"}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch the dependencies.

## Usage

After installing Waffle, another two things should be done:

1. setup a storage provider
2. define a definition module

### Setup a storage provider

Waffle has three built-in storage providers:

- `Waffle.Storage.Local`
- `Waffle.Storage.S3`
- `Waffle.Storage.Azure`

[Other available storage providers](#other-storage-providers)
are supported by the community.

An example for setting up `Waffle.Storage.Local`:

```elixir
config :waffle,
  storage: Waffle.Storage.Local,
  asset_host: "http://static.example.com" # or {:system, "ASSET_HOST"}
```

An example for setting up `Waffle.Storage.S3`:

```elixir
config :waffle,
  storage: Waffle.Storage.S3,
  bucket: "custom_bucket",                # or {:system, "AWS_S3_BUCKET"}
  asset_host: "http://static.example.com" # or {:system, "ASSET_HOST"}

config :ex_aws,
  json_codec: Jason
  # any configurations provided by https://github.com/ex-aws/ex_aws
```

An example for setting up `Waffle.Storage.Azure`:

```elixir
config :waffle,
  storage: Waffle.Storage.Azure,
  storage_account: "mystorageaccount",    # or {:system, "AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT"}
  container: "uploads",                   # or {:system, "AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER"}
  access_key: "your-access-key",          # or {:system, "AZURE_ACCESS_KEY"}
  public_access: false,                   # Set to true for public access
  expiry_in_minutes: 60                   # SAS token expiry for private access
```

### Define a definition module

Waffle requires a **definition module** which contains the relevant
functions to store and retrieve files:

- Optional transformations of the uploaded file
- Where to put your files (the storage directory)
- How to name your files
- How to secure your files (private? Or publicly accessible?)
- Default placeholders

This module can be created manually or generated by `mix waffle.g`
automatically.

As an example, we will generate a definition module for handling
avatars:

    mix waffle.g avatar

This should generate a file at `lib/[APP_NAME]_web/uploaders/avatar.ex`.
Check this file for descriptions of configurable options.

## Examples

- [An example for Local storage driver](documentation/examples/local.md)
- [An example for S3 storage driver](documentation/examples/s3.md)
- [An example for Azure Blob Storage driver](documentation/examples/azure.md)

## Usage with Ecto

Waffle comes with a companion package for use with Ecto. If you
intend to use Waffle with Ecto, it is highly recommended you also
add the
[`waffle_ecto`](https://github.com/elixir-waffle/waffle_ecto)
dependency. Benefits include:

- Changeset integration
- Versioned urls for cache busting (`.../thumb.png?v=63601457477`)

## Other Storage Providers

- **Rackspace** - [arc_rackspace](https://github.com/lokalebasen/arc_rackspace)

- **Manta** - [arc_manta](https://github.com/onyxrev/arc_manta)

- **OVH** - [arc_ovh](https://github.com/stephenmoloney/arc_ovh)

- **Google Cloud Storage** - [waffle_gcs](https://github.com/elixir-waffle/waffle_gcs)

- **Microsoft Azure Storage** - Built-in `Waffle.Storage.Azure` or [arc_azure](https://github.com/phil-a/arc_azure)

- **Aliyun OSS Storage** - [waffle_aliyun_oss](https://github.com/ug0/waffle_aliyun_oss)

## Testing

The basic test suite can be run with without supplying any S3 information:

```
mix test
```

In order to test S3 capability, you must have access to an S3/equivalent bucket. For
S3 buckets, the bucket must be configured to allow ACLs and it must allow public
access.

The following environment variables will be used by the test suite:

**For S3 testing:**

- WAFFLE_TEST_BUCKET
- WAFFLE_TEST_BUCKET2
- WAFFLE_TEST_S3_KEY
- WAFFLE_TEST_S3_SECRET
- WAFFLE_TEST_REGION

**For Azure testing:**

- AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT
- AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER
- AZURE_ACCESS_KEY

After setting these variables, you can run the full test suite with `mix test --include s3:true` or `mix test --include azure:true`.
