[Waffle] is a flexible file upload library for Elixir with straightforward integrations for Amazon S3 and ImageMagick.

[Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/waffle)

Thanks [Evrone design team] for Waffle's branding.

What else we [build with Elixir] at Evrone.

## Installation

Add the latest stable release to your `mix.exs` file, along with the required dependencies for `ExAws` if appropriate:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:waffle, "~> 1.0.1"},

    # If using S3:
    {:ex_aws, "~> 2.1.2"},
    {:ex_aws_s3, "~> 2.0"},
    {:hackney, "~> 1.9"},
    {:sweet_xml, "~> 0.6"}
  ]
end
```

Then run `mix deps.get` in your shell to fetch the dependencies.

### Configuration

Waffle expects certain properties to be configured at the application level:

```elixir
config :waffle,
  storage: Waffle.Storage.S3, # or Waffle.Storage.Local
  bucket: {:system, "AWS_S3_BUCKET"}, # if using S3
  asset_host: "http://static.example.com" # or {:system, "ASSET_HOST"}

# If using S3:
config :ex_aws,
  json_codec: Jason
```

Along with any configuration necessary for ExAws.

### Usage with Ecto

Waffle comes with a companion package for use with Ecto.  If you intend to use Waffle with Ecto, it is highly recommended you also add the [`waffle_ecto`](https://github.com/elixir-waffle/waffle_ecto) dependency.  Benefits include:

  * Changeset integration
  * Versioned urls for cache busting (`.../thumb.png?v=63601457477`)
